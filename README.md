# Getting Started
### What's this?
After following [this tutorial](https://dzone.com/articles/rsocket-with-spring-boot-amp-js-zero-to-hero),
you will build the back-end service and the front-end web UI using RSocket.

And this repo is an Android version of Demo Application and it will call the back-end service.

### How to run?
This only works locally.
- You need to get the back-end service up running.
- Open the demo application using Android Studio emulator.
